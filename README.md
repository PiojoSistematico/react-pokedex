## Overview

### The challenge

This project is part of a series of challenges to learn react and typescript.

This was my first attempt to learn react, i followed a good tutorial of the great [JeffHerrington] (https://www.youtube.com/@jherr), as you can notice the pokedex looks ugly because I overestimated my css knowledge and that was my best at that time. I started to focus on learning css and the react series was paused until i could come out with a not horrible css, i think the rest of the series have a better look overall.

i keep this project as a reminder of the little improvements that i have made in react and css.
